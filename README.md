# Sequelize_JS
#This is a sample JS project to identify the concept of working of Sequelize 
Create a folder and open the terminal and run npm init -y
This will give you a normal package.json file
Instead of that, copy my json file and install those dependencies using npm install
After installation, you will get a node modules installed file and details of every thing in a package-lock.json file

After the installation of every dependencies we can start coding!!!

Use my newserver.js file to understand more about the code.
You will see server and newserver; newserver is the code that we are inserting bulk data in json format, the other is to understand just to insert a single data

Users.json file has 100 datas, which I am inserting through js to database with sequelize
Here I used sqlite3 as the db
